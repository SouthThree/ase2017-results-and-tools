IMPORTANT NOTES:

The tools are only tested on a Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 machine and are not 
guranteed to be runnable in other platforms.


HOW TO RUN THE TOOLS?

For each tool check the "run.sh" script to find the detailed commands for 
running the tool. Note that the file paths in each script are based on the 
'pwd' command, thus change to corresponding tool folder before running 
"bash run.sh". The file "time-toolname.txt" inside each tool folder records
the time for running each benchmark program. The directory "out-toolname" 
inside each tool folder contains the tool output in a sub-directory for each 
benchmark program.

Another note is that the hola tool depends on a specific version of GCC which 
is too large to be included in this folder and the binary for hola is also 
large and thus are not included. Please follow the instructions in the script 
file "hola/hola-setup.txt" to download, build, and run hola.

To repeate the experimental results for FiB's forward analysis, backward analysis, 
and bidirectional analysis, please provide an option -fd, -bd, and -bi, respecitively 
for running the script "run-ase17.sh" inside "Fib_Tool" folder, e.g., use command 
"bash run.sh -bd" to run FiB's backward analysis for the benchmarks.
