verifying assertion: (x = y)
find an inductive invaraint in backward interpolation  based on concrete reachables!
invariant size: 13
interp: (not (and (not (= x y)) (and (not (= turn 0)) (<= 6 turn))))
The assertion is satisfied!
forward [0] times, backtrack [0] times
backward [0] times, backtrack [0] times
