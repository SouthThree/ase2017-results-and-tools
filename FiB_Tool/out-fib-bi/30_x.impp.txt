verifying assertion: (c >= 0)
find an inductive invaraint in backward interpolation  based on concrete reachables!
invariant size: 28
interp: (and (not (<= c (- 1))) (and (not (<= i (- 1))) (and (not (<= i (- 2))) (and (not (<= i (- 3))) (and (not (<= i (- 4))) (and (not (<= i (- 5))) (not (<= i (- 6)))))))))
The assertion is satisfied!
forward [22] times, backtrack [11] times
backward [22] times, backtrack [11] times
