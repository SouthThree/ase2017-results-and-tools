verifying assertion: (x <= 1)
find an inductive invaraint in backward interpolation  based on concrete reachables!
invariant size: 18
interp: (and (<= x 1) (not (and (<= 1 x) (<= (to_real (+ w (* (- 2) (to_int (* (/ 1 2) (to_real (+ (* 1 w) (- 1)))))))) (to_real 1)))))
The assertion is satisfied!
forward [2] times, backtrack [1] times
backward [2] times, backtrack [1] times
